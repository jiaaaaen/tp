AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* 
* Items together in curly square brackets means one and only one of them must be given as input.<br>
  e.g `{n/NAME t/TAG}` can be used as `n/John Doe` or as `t/friends`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Edits an existing person in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.
* Note that you cannot edit `schedule` and `socialMedia` information using the `edit` command. Please use the `schedule` and `socialMedia` command instead.

Examples:

### Scheduling Contacts: `schedule`

Adds a schedule to contact in the address book.
Schedule names can be renamed based on your requirements. 

Format: `schedule INDEX [sn/ALTERNATE_NAME] [sd/SCHEDULE_DATE] [st/SCHEDULE_TIME]`

* A schedule will only be valid if it has a `SCHEDULE_DATE`. `ALTERNATE_NAME` and `SCHEDULE_TIME` will not be displayed unless a schedule has a `SCHEDULE_DATE`.
* `INDEX` refers to the number shown in the displayed person list, and is 1-based.
* If all the optional parameters are omitted and the contact has an existing schedule, the existing schedule will be removed.
* If the provided contact does not have an existing schedule, the `schedule` command must be provided with at least `SCHEDULE_DATE` to attach a schedule to the contact.
* If the provided contact has an existing schedule, the provided parameters will overwrite the existing schedule's parameters and keep the omitted parameters unchanged.
* `ALTERNATE_NAME` must strictly be alphanumerical.
* `SCHEDULE_DATE` must be in the format `yyyy-MM-dd`.
* `SCHEDULE_TIME` must be in the format `HH:mm`.

Examples:

### Renaming a Tag : `renameTag`

Renames an existing tag in the address book.

Format: `renameTag ot/OLDTAG nt/NEWTAG`

* Renames the tags called `OLDTAG` to `NEWTAG`.
* Contacts with the tag `OLDTAG` will now have `NEWTAG`, with `OLDTAG` removed
* If `OLDTAG` is not an existing tag, `[OLDTAG] tag is not found` will be returned.
* If there are any contacts with both `[OLDTAG]` and `[NEWTAG]`, the `[OLDTAG]` will not be renamed as this will lead to duplicated tags.

### Adding Social Media : `socialMedia`

Adds or updates the social media handle to an existing person.

Format: `socialMedia [ig/USERNAME] [fb/USERNAME] [cs/USERNAME]`

* Contacts will have their social media handle displayed as `[ig-igusername]` or `[fb-fbusername]` or `[cs-csusername]`.
* `ig`,`fb`, and `cs` is used to represent Instagram, Facebook, and Carousell handles respectively.
* If the contact already has an existing social media handle, their handle will be updated.
* Hence, we can only add one social media handle to each contact.
* Handles must be non empty, have a limit of 30 characters,and consist only of alphanumeric characters, or `-`, `_` and `.`.
* If multiple handles are entered, only the last handle will be accepted. Eg. `socialMedia 1 ig/first cs/second` will only add the handle `[cs-second]` to the user.

Examples:
*  `socialMedia 3 ig/charlotteo` Adds the handle `[ig-charlotteo]` to the third contact Charlotte.

### Sort persons by name: `sort`

### Backing up save file : `backup`

Creates a backup of the current save file.

Format: `backup`

* Backup AddressBook data will be saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/backup/addressbook.json`.
* If a addressbook.json file already exists in the backup folder it will be overwritten.
* The backup file can be used in order to restore the AddressBook data in case of data loss, or to transfer the data to another device.
* Users can safely move or copy the backup file to another device, without worrying above negative consequences.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
